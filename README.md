SIT 2021-2025 FINAL Year Project

# Description

This project explores Natural Language Processing (NLP) and sentiment analysis on the popular social platform Reddit. The study uses advanced NLP models, specifically BERT and ROBERTa, to understand and interpret the sentiments expressed in these discussions, with a focus on diverse topics such as sports, politics, sustainability, and fitness. The project seeks to decode the complex opinions and attitudes present in these various domains by leveraging Reddit's diverse communities and wealth of textual data. The primary goal is to interpret the complexities of sentiment characteristics in order to provide valuable insights into the public's opinions and attitudes. This analysis, which makes use of these state-of-the-art NLP models, seeks to provide thorough understandings of the prevailing sentiment within the subjects discussed, thereby providing a comprehensive assessment of public opinions across these important fields.
